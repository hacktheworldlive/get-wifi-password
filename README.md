Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.

Run the Script: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org. Then run the script in a command prompt with administrative privileges:

python wifi_passwords.py

# Usage 

Profile Name                 | Password
--------------------------------------------------
HomeNetwork                  | mysecurepassword
OfficeNetwork                | office123
GuestNetwork                 | No password found


Notes:
If a profile does not have a saved password, it will display "No password found" in the output.
Ethical Considerations
This script is intended for educational purposes and should only be used to retrieve Wi-Fi passwords for networks you own or have explicit permission to access.
Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the right to access and retrieve information from the network profiles you are querying.
